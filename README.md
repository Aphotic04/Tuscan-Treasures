# Tuscan-Treasures
A website designed to represent a small business in Tuscany as means to increase tourism

This was a final project for Client-Side Web Development. 
The project entailed having two other classmates as partners on the project. Although we all had the same amount of experience, I had further understanding
of HTML, JS, and CSS so I we agreed that I take over as project lead and together we created this website. The design, final layout, and final code are all done by me.
